                    <li><strong>NOT JUST THE BASICS</strong>&nbsp;- I’m sure you already know about volunteering at shelters, donating money and fostering animals which is absolutely an amazing way to help animals if not the best way you can help shelters and the animals. However, since not everyone has the resources to be able to donate, foster or there might be a reason that you aren’t able to volunteer at a shelter, we wanted to create this list to show you 3 additional ways to help right from the comfort of your home.</li><li><strong>SHARING ON SOCIAL MEDIA</strong> - Since you follow us on Facebook and maybe even Instagram, we do a spotlight on an animal from a shelter on a daily basis. By sharing those posts, commenting on them, or tagging someone on that post, you are helping get more exposure for that animal. It may seem like a small thing but we have found that all it takes is a couple people sharing a post and those animals have a 2-10x better chance of getting adopted. So each and every time you see a post on our page or on a shelter/rescue’s page about an animal, make sure to like it, share it and tag someone for the best results.</li><li><strong>SHARING YOUR CONNECTIONS</strong> - Here at Lens And Leash, we try to schedule as many photoshoots in shelters around the country but we have found that the main bottleneck is getting in contact with shelters. We don’t blame them since we know how difficult it can be and there are only so many hours in the day. So the main way you can help is if you have any connections to anyone that works or volunteers at a shelter, share Lens and Leash with them and have them connect with us at: info@lensandleash.com so we can continually getting more exposure for animals in shelters.</li>
                    <li><strong>SHARING YOUR ADOPTION STORY</strong> - If you haven’t already, make sure you check out our “Furever Homes” section on lensandleash.com. We know sometimes there can be a stigma about adopting an animal instead of buying from a breeder or animal store. The more we can remove that stigma and tell the amazing stories people have when adopting, the higher the likelihood will be that anyone looking for animal will adopt reducing the number of euthanasias each year. To share your adoption story, all you have to do is fill out this form: https://lensandleash.com/adoption-story-submission/&nbsp;</li>

Sporting dogs is a product of years of breeding to come out with dogs that work closely with their owners and are comfortable on land, and is not intimidated by water. Sporting dogs also called gun dogs are popular for their ability to work with other dogs. They excel in outdoor activities as they are bred for hunting. Sporting dogs are loyal and friendly. They love interacting and playing with the whole family and are protective with children. Another endearing quality of the sporting dog is being affectionate and gentle.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Herding Dogs – Are also known as pastoral or working dogs. These dog breed are trained to work with other animals. Some herding dogs work well with most animals while other breeds are trained over generations to work with specific groups of animals making them adapted to specific animal traits enhancing their ability to the animal group that they are working on. Typically, animals that sporting dogs works best are sheep, cattle, deer, goats, and poultry. Herding dogs generally are intelligent animals. Their ability to follow commands is renowned all over the world. Herding dogs makes good family pets. However, they are most happy when they are used as workers. That is the purpose of their breeding and they are seldom happy when inactive. Herding dogs are very lively and strong and need a lot of exercise and activity. Some of the most popular breed of herding dogs are the Coolie, Shepherd, Kelpie, Sheepdog, Herder, Corgi and Terriers.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Hound Dogs – Hound dogs are also sporting dogs although its main purpose is to track their prey. Different from sporting dogs, hound dogs do not raise their tail to the direction of the prey like pointers nor do they kill them like retrievers. Instead they assist hunters by chasing the prey using their scant and sight. There are variations of hound dogs. The most popular are the Scent Dogs and the Sight Dogs.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The Scent Dogs – We all know that dogs have superior ability to smell and distinguish scents. Scent dogs though are on the top of the list for using their have spectacular sense of smell that enables them to track their prey several miles away. Scent dogs have droopy ears and long moist noses and lips that traps more scent particles that in turn enhance their sense of smell.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The Sight Dogs – Are agile and have the endurance to track down and chase their prey. Unlike sight hounds, these dog breeds use their superior ability to spot even small moving objects from a good distance. Sight hounds are fast runners. Because of that, they are characterized by highly flexible spines, deep chest, and big lungs and have very nimble bodies.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Non-sporting dogs – Are dogs that were previously bred for specific tasks. As times changed, so did their duties and purpose. There is no definite category for these dog breeds except that over the years their function were deemed less important than the general value that they serve whether as pets, entertainers, companions, guardians etc. Generally these dogs have good appearance but because there is no particular breeding for purpose, non-sporting dogs are now what we may call an all-purpose dog that shares all the positive features found in all dog breeds but may have no particular outstanding trait.</span><br></p></div>
